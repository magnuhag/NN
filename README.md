# Hobby project project: building an improved neural network 

I wrote a neural network as an assignment/ project whilst doing my degree in physics at the University of Oslo. At the time I was inexperienced with OOP, and the whole project was rushed due to lack of time. It's safe to say the result was lacking.

In my unemployment I've found time to improve upon the original architecture and design of the network, and this is currently what's happening in this repo.
The neural net found here is by no means complete (as one could infer from the comments in the code), but it is currently semi-functional.

I will also add comprehensive documentation when "done"
